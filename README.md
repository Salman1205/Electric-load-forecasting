# Electric Load Forecasting

This repository contains code for electric load forecasting using machine learning techniques.

## Repository Structure

- `Preprocessing/`: Contains preprocessing and model training notebooks
  - `preprocessing1.ipynb`: Initial data preprocessing
  - `preprocessing2.ipynb`: Advanced data preprocessing
  - `Clustering&ML_Training.ipynb`: Clustering and ML model training

## Note on Model Files

The trained models (*.joblib files) are not included in this repository due to their large size. These files include:
- rf_model.joblib
- kmeans.joblib
- pca.joblib
- scaler.joblib

If you need access to the trained models, please contact the repository owner.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the preprocessing notebooks in order
3. The Clustering&ML_Training notebook contains the model training code

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required packages are listed in the notebook imports
